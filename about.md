<h1 class="Page-title">About</h1>

<p class="Lede"><strong>Hey, I'm Josh Kennedy.</strong> I'm the owner and founder of <a href="https://www.mightandmethod.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Might & Method</a>, a boutique digital agency in Nashville, TN. I spent six years doing product design and development with startups in Singapore and New York City before putting down roots in middle Tennessee.</p>

Over the years, I've put my expertise to work as a hired gun, doing freelance design and development work for various clients and agencies.

I currently spend my working hours disrupting the toxic money cultue with the folks at [Ramsey Solutions](https://www.ramseyinhouse.com){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

In my spare time, I like to tinker with [my side hustle](https://www.zendstation.com){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} and [bake bread from scratch](https://www.instagram.com/the_cheeky_baker){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

I retweet things I find funny on Twitter as [@joshkennedy](https://www.twitter.com/joshkennedy){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. You can see bits of things I'm working on [Dribbble](https://www.dibbble.com/joshkennedy){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} and [Github](https://www.github.com/joshkennedy){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.
