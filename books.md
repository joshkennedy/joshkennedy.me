<h1 class="Page-title">Books</h1>

I'm usually reading 3-4 books at any given time. I like to read something edifying and faith-building with my
morning coffee, listen to an audiobook during my commute, read something non-fiction in the evenings and on weekends,
and fall asleep reading something fictonal before bed.
