<h1 class="Page-title">Books</h1>

<p class="Lede">This year I set myself the goal of reading 50 books.</p>

I've managed to [stay in front of my goal so far](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13207293-josh){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. As I type this, I'm about three books ahead of schedule. We'll see if that holds up.

I'm reading 3-4 books at any given time. I typically read something edifying and faith-building to read with my morning coffee, an audiobook during my commute, something non-fiction for the evenings and weekends, and a ficton that I'll read before bed.
